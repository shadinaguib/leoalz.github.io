**Does mobility make or break friendships?**<br>

We propose to study the effects of mobility on friendships. To do so, we propose to use datasets capturing global-scale Check-in Data collected from Foursquare, a location based social network (LBSN). The dataset contains check-in information during a 22 month period with two snapshots of friendship data before and after the data collection period. This will let us evaluate the impact of mobility on friendships. This format will allow us to train and test a model that predicts the amount of friendships a user will make or break during the data collection period.
